# World Population Data Analysis

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the world population data from 1970 to 2022 using the dataset `world_population.csv`.

## Dataset
- **Dataset Name**: `world_population.csv`
- **Description**: This dataset contains population data for countries from 1970 to 2022. Each row represents a country, and each column contains population figures for different years, as well as additional details such as land area, population density, and growth rate.
- **Columns**:
  - `Country`: Name of the country
  - `Continent`: Continent where the country is located
  - `1970 Population` to `2022 Population`: Population of the country for each year
  - `Area (km²)`: Land area of the country in square kilometers
  - `Density (per km²)`: Population density (people per square kilometer)
  - `Growth Rate`: Annual growth rate of the population
  - `World Population Percentage`: Percentage of the world’s population for each country

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Correlation Analysis**: Investigated the relationships between population, area, and density to understand how these variables interact across countries.
- **Population Growth**: Visualized population growth trends for countries over the years, including high-population countries like China and India.

### Visualizations
Several visualizations were created to understand the population trends:
